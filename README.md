# 🚀 Space Invaders

A classic arcade-style shooter game built from scratch in Python as my A-Level Computer Science summer project.

## 🎮 About

This is a complete recreation of the classic Space Invaders arcade game, featuring progressive difficulty and engaging gameplay mechanics. Players defend Earth by controlling a ground cannon and shooting down waves of descending alien invaders.

## ✨ Features

- **Player Controls**: Smooth arrow key movement and spacebar shooting mechanics
- **Adaptive Enemy AI**: Aliens increase speed and move closer as the game progresses
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: Multiple levels with escalating challenge
- **Scoring System**: Track your performance across gameplay sessions
- **Collision Detection**: Precise hit detection for projectiles and enemies
- **Custom Rendering**: Built-in visual system for sprites, enemies, and projectiles

## 🛠️ Built With

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pygame** - Graphics and game loop management

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/parthavic62/space-invaders-game.git
cd space-invaders-game

Install dependencies:

pip install pygame

Run the game:

python space_invaders.py


🎯 How to Play

← → Arrow keys to move your cannon left and right
Spacebar to shoot
Goal: Destroy all alien invaders before they reach the bottom
Survive through increasingly difficult levels!

📚 What I Learned
This project taught me:

Game loop architecture and frame-based updates
Object-oriented programming for game entities
State management for game progression
Collision detection algorithms
Event handling and user input processing
Balancing gameplay mechanics for player engagement

🔮 Future Improvements

Add sound effects and background music
Implement power-ups and special weapons
Create boss battles
Add high score persistence
Develop additional enemy types with unique behaviors
