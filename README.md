Space Invaders

A classic arcade-style shooter game built from scratch in Python as my A-Level Computer Science summer project.

About

This is a complete recreation of the classic Space Invaders arcade game, featuring progressive difficulty and engaging gameplay mechanics. Players defend Earth by controlling a ground cannon and shooting down waves of descending alien invaders.

Features

- **Player Controls**: Smooth arrow key movement and spacebar shooting mechanics
- **Adaptive Enemy AI**: Aliens increase speed and move closer as the game progresses
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: Multiple levels with escalating challenge
- **Scoring System**: Track your performance across gameplay sessions
- **Collision Detection**: Precise hit detection for projectiles and enemies
- **Custom Rendering**: Built-in visual system for sprites, enemies, and projectiles

Built With

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pygame** - Graphics and game loop management

 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/parthavic62/space-invaders-game.git
cd space-invaders-game

2. Install dependencies:

pip install pygame

3. Run the game:

python space_invaders.py


-----------How to Play---------------

← → Arrow keys to move your cannon left and right
Spacebar to shoot
Goal: Destroy all alien invaders before they reach the bottom
Survive through increasingly difficult levels!

What I Learned
This project taught me:

Game loop architecture and frame-based updates
Object-oriented programming for game entities
State management for game progression
Collision detection algorithms
Event handling and user input processing
Balancing gameplay mechanics for player engagement

Future Improvements

Add sound effects and background music
Implement power-ups and special weapons
Create boss battles
Add high score persistence
Develop additional enemy types with unique behaviors
